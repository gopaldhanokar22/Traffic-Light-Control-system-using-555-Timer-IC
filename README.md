Traffic Light Control system using 555 Timer IC


The IC555 timer is designed to use in controlling of traffic light signals, using LED to indicate a light signals. The traffic signals move 20ms at a particular time. the proposed circuit are designed by using simulation software, cadence pspice and hardware implementation is done by using breadboard. By tuning the value of variable resistor the alteration can be achieved, based on selecting HZ to MHZ value, Frequency is varied, by using IC555 timer we observed various frequency levels. According to design specifications we are choosing resister and capacitor values. Generation of clock signal for first timer, we have to assume, T1 (time period) is 6.96ms, T2 (time period) is 6.93ms. And the total time period (T) of generating one square waveform is 13.89ms.the frequency (f) of the one oscillation for first timer is 72HZ.
